Group 15

Wind Simulation project

The is a Godot Application, to use the program you can run the executable or download Godot 4.3 and run it through the engine. An easy way to run the program is with the shortcut F5. This project will use fluid dynamics to stimulate wind acting upon physics objects using a premade fluid engine, and lattice Boltzmann equations. In the current build of the application, we have a simple fluid falling onto a rigid physics object, we will hopefully have the lattice Boltzmann equations implemented soon.
